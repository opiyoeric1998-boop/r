                <h2>Introduction: Fostering a Love for Language</h2>
                <p>At Jets Elementary School, our Literacy Program is designed to ignite a passion for reading and writing that will last a lifetime. We believe literacy is the foundation for all learning, and our <span class="highlight_term">holistic approach</span> ensures every child develops the skills and confidence to express themselves effectively.</p>
                <p>Our curriculum, aligned with the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) framework, focuses on developing well-rounded communicators who can navigate the world with clarity, empathy, and critical thinking. We create a nurturing environment where students discover the joy of stories, the power of words, and the excitement of sharing their own ideas.</p>

                <h2>The Four Pillars of Literacy (CBC Aligned)</h2>
                <p>Our comprehensive literacy program is built upon four interconnected pillars, each essential for developing competent, confident communicators:</p>
                
                <div class="pillars_container">
                    <div class="pillar">
                        <h4>1. Foundational Reading Skills</h4>
                        <p>We begin with systematic <span class="highlight_term">phonics and phonemic awareness</span> instruction, helping students decode words with confidence. Our structured approach ensures mastery of letter-sound relationships, sight words, and reading fluency as the essential building blocks for comprehension.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="pillar">
                        <h4>2. Comprehension & Critical Thinking</h4>
                        <p>Moving beyond decoding, we teach students to engage deeply with texts. Through guided reading sessions and thoughtful discussions, children develop <span class="highlight_term">critical thinking and comprehension</span> strategies, learning to analyze, infer, and connect ideas across different subjects and contexts.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="pillar">
                        <h4>3. Expressive Writing & Communication</h4>
                        <p>Students learn to organize and express their thoughts clearly through various writing forms—from creative stories to factual reports. We emphasize the writing process, grammar skills, and vocabulary development, empowering children to communicate effectively for different audiences and purposes.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="pillar">
                        <h4>4. Oral Language & Listening</h4>
                        <p>Strong literacy includes speaking and listening skills. Through presentations, group discussions, drama activities, and attentive listening exercises, students develop confidence in verbal expression and learn to engage respectfully with diverse perspectives.</p>

            <div class="content_section">
                <h2>Learning in Action (Our Methods)</h2>
                <p>Our literacy instruction comes alive through research-based methods that meet each child where they are:</p>
                
                <ul class="methods_list">
                    <li><strong>Differentiated Instruction:</strong> Recognizing that each child learns uniquely, we provide <span class="highlight_term">differentiated instruction</span> through small group activities, leveled reading materials, and tailored writing tasks that challenge and support every learner.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Rich Classroom Libraries:</strong> Each classroom features a carefully curated <span class="highlight_term">rich classroom library</span> with diverse texts that reflect our students' experiences and expand their horizons, encouraging independent reading for pleasure.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Integrated Literacy Blocks:</strong> Our daily literacy blocks seamlessly connect reading, writing, speaking, and listening activities around meaningful themes, showing students how these skills work together in <span class="highlight_term">real-world application</span>.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Authentic Writing Opportunities:</strong> Students write for authentic purposes—creating class newspapers, penning letters to community members, composing poetry for school events, and documenting science observations—making literacy meaningful and relevant.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Technology Integration:</strong> We thoughtfully incorporate educational technology, including literacy apps, digital storytelling tools, and online research resources, to enhance traditional reading and writing instruction.</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Assessment and Progress Section -->
            <div class="content_section">
                <h2>Assessment and Progress</h2>
                <p>We believe assessment should inform instruction and celebrate growth. Our comprehensive approach includes:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Ongoing Formative Assessment:</strong> Through daily observations, reading conferences, writing samples, and skill checks, we continuously monitor each child's progress and adjust instruction to meet their evolving needs.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Benchmark Reading Assessments:</strong> Three times per year, we conduct formal reading assessments to measure fluency, accuracy, and comprehension, providing clear data on each student's progression through reading levels.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Portfolio-Based Evaluation:</strong> Students maintain literacy portfolios showcasing their growth as readers and writers throughout the year. These portfolios are shared with parents during conferences, highlighting achievements and next steps.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Parent Communication:</strong> We maintain regular communication with families through reading logs, weekly newsletters, parent-teacher conferences, and digital platforms, ensuring you're informed and involved in your child's literacy journey.</p>
                
                <p>Our goal is to provide specific, actionable feedback that helps each student understand their strengths and areas for growth, fostering a growth mindset and lifelong love of learning.</p>
